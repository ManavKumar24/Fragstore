     <h3>Mount Blanc Legend</h3>
<p>Mont Blanc Explorer by Mont Blanc. Now, this men's scent launched in 2019 as a new pillar fragrance for the designer. Ideal for any season but winter, this scent is dominated by notes of ambroxan, bergamot, and Akigalawood, creating a warm, masculine scent. Other notes include top notes of pink pepper and clary sage, heart notes of leather and vetiver, and base notes of patchouli and cacao. I love it for its longevity, especially given that it never becomes overwhelming.
